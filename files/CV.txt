Dear Digital Extremes Team,

I've long admired Digital Extremes for your innovative and high quality approach to game development, particularly with Warframe, which I've enjoyed extensively. My passion for gaming inspired me to pursue degrees in Computer Science and gain hands on experience with Unity and C#.

Most recently, I developed and published a mobile game titled Gunslinger, now available on the Google Play Store. This project taught me a great deal about managing timelines, refining ideas based on feedback, and overcoming technical challenges. My experience also includes project management, research, and providing technical support.

While I may not yet have several years of professional experience, I am highly driven and eager to contribute. I am currently pursuing my master's degree and am available to work full time remotely. I'm confident that my dedication, skills, and passion would make me a valuable addition to your team, and I would be thrilled by the opportunity to work for you guys.

Thank you very much for considering my application. I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

Nicholas Fantino-Dyer
